# TriangleCT

This repository contains the code for X-ray tomographic reconstruction on tetrahedra meshes (FE-like meshes) instead of the classic voxel-based images.

The code is MATLAB-CUDA and works in multiple GPUs. The code assumes that you have a tetrahedra mesh, it does not triangulate. Some demos are provided.
